            <h2>Summer 2024</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>As part of the University of Guelph co-op program I was required to create some goals at the start of the work term I’d hope to achieve by the end. Here’s what they were and how this work term helped me with them:</p>
                <ol>
                    <h4><li>Improve my knowledge of the .NET framework and C#</li></h4>
                    <p>This was an important goal to work towards as I hadn't worked with C# and .NET before and wanted to take full advantage of the learning opportunity that being exposed to existing .NET projects all summer would provide. I was working independantly for most of the work term and had to create a new Blazor web app from scratch. As such I learned a great deal about .NET and Blazor and have a solid understanding of creating a full stack application with these tools. Coming from more of a React and Node background this was an interesting change of pace and a great learning experience. I am far more confident in my ability to work with C# as well which is something I'd like to carry over into some game development projects I've wanted to work on for a while now.</p>
                    
                    <h4><li>Learn Azure services and gain a better understanding of CI/CD pipelines</li></h4>
                    <p>On previous work terms I had only ever worked with existing pipelines and DevOps services that had been set up prior to my employment. On one hand I liked this because I didn't have to worry about any DevOps issues but I also didn't get a complete understanding of how our builds were deployed and managed outside of version control. During this work term I got to work with Azure to some extent and now understand a lot of these background processes much better. I'm currently taking the Software Engineering class at UoG this semester so this was the perfect as I'm going into it with some prior knowledge. The only thing that didn't quite work out with this goal was that I did not have access to a lot of the permissions I needed to implement some of the features I wanted to.</p>
                
                    <h4><li>Improve my problem solving skills with unknown tools</li></h4>
                    <p>There were a few tools I hadn't used going into this term, primarily C# and .NET, but also Azure. I wanted to be able to learn them efficiently so that I could get going as soon as possible and as such I thought this would be a good goal to work towards. My last co-op had a very long onboarding process and I wanted to see if I could work through the errors of installing and working with new tools efficiently at this one. I also wanted to improve how quickly it takes me to understand tools I hadn't worked with previously. I can definitely say that I've gotten more efficient at reading through documentation and applying existing knowledge to new problems.</p>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Overall I can say that I definitely achieved the goals I set out to do, although there wasn't as many extra learning experiences that I hadn't planned on like my previous placement. However, that's definitely just because the scope was smaller and didn't include as many extra tools I wasn't aware of when writing my initial learning goals.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Job Description</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>I worked with the two other members of the Student Housing IT Department to handle tickets across our office and occasionally at other locations on campus. Although, my main goal was to build a Blazor application to facilitate a variety of internal tooling and scripts for Student Housing.</p>
                <p>During my time at this placement I updated old scripts to .NET 8.0 and converted several php scripts into C#/.NET to be used in the Blazor app. As such I did a variety of frontend and backend work, I interfaced with existings APIs and our SQL database, and I also added security measures to these internal scripts as they had previously all been run off a secure computer. All of this internal tooling originally ran off a secure computer within the IT department and wasn't intended to be accesed by anyone but the owner of said computer. As such I spent a good portion of time adding security measures and integrating the tooling into our Azure services to be more secure.</p>
                <p>I also improved/updated some University of Guelph student housing web pages that I had to use when I was in my first year which was pretty neat.</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>I had a great time working at this placement. Just like my last work term it was a great work environment with good coworkers. It was a great learning experience and I'm quite satisfied with the skills I've gained and the additions I can now make to my resume. While it was a great work term I don't think I'd want to do a similar job again; however, I think I now know what kind of career path I want to follow which I was definitely much more uncertain of when I started.</p>

            <h2>Fall 2023</h2>
            
            <h3>Info</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>My Fall 2023 work term was in Waterloo, Ontario at NCR, a banking software and teller hardware company. If you shop at Metro you’ve probably seen NCR branded self checkout machines but that’s the only example I’ve personally seen. About halfway through the term the company split into NCR Atleos and NCR Voyix to differentiate the hardware and software sides of the company respectively.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>As part of the University of Guelph co-op program I was required to create some goals at the start of the work term I’d hope to achieve by the end. Here’s what they were and how this work term helped me with them:</p>
                <ol>
                    <h4><li>Gain a better understanding of object oriented programming</li></h4>
                    <p>I set this as one of my goals as a good portion of the work was in Java and in class it wasn’t covered in depth. In the past I’d done plenty of Java work on personal projects but working in an existing codebase gave me a far better understanding of object oriented principles and how different aspects of the code should interact with each other. I’m especially glad that I was able to work on the full-stack team as it allowed me to piece together on my own how certain practices in the backend benefitted the front end. Being exposed to this gave me a much better understanding of why certain practices exist far more than I would have just studying them. Going forward I have a much better understanding of Java and the benefit of object oriented programming and I will definitely be able to write object oriented code better and far easier in my future work terms.</p>
                    
                    <h4><li>Learn Agile workflow concepts and work effectively within the SCRUM model</li></h4>
                    <p>Before this work term I’d never been in a real Agile team before; in class we had done group work where we tried to replicate the workflow but there were no daily stand-up or sprint/PI planning meetings, no SCRUM master, and no ticketing system. There was a lot that was only really mentioned or talked about in class which wouldn’t have made a whole lot of sense to do in the context of the group work so it was definitely a great learning experience to actually work within a real SCRUM environment. I was able to contribute in daily stand-ups, design meetings, and sprint planning and was exposed to pretty much every part of the agile workflow process not included in my past classes. At the start of the work term it seemed like a lot but now that I’ve had the experience of working in a proper Agile team I am confident in my abilities to work and collaborate with others far better in future job placements.</p>
                
                    <h4><li>Learn how to collaborate on enterprise software</li></h4>
                    <p>This was an important goal for me as I hadn’t worked on enterprise software before and was nervous about working on large repositories of code that I was unfamiliar with. I wanted to come out of this co-op term feeling confident in my abilities to understand and work with a team on a large codebase without breaking anything. After this term though I am confident in my ability to break down and understand large code bases and how various services interact with each other. While NCR’s codebase was daunting at first I’m certain that going forward I will have a much easier time effectively contributing to large scale software.</p>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>I was looking to get some experience with Docker as I hadn’t needed to learn it for school or personal projects before but had always heard it was extensively used. During this work term I was well exposed to working with Docker as well as a variety of other tools. Although I had used it before, I gained a lot of experience with postman this term as it was used to test API endpoints. Yaml was something I had only briefly touched in the past but it was used for all of the config files for the API I worked on so I got a lot of experience with properly setting up and using Swagger/List files. I also learned how to work with tickets in Jira which I hadn’t done before. Overall I think I completed each of the goals I set for myself and learned a good deal of new things I hadn’t initially planned/expected to.</p>

            <h3>Job Description</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>I was a part of one of the company’s Agile development teams, specifically the full-stack team “Draft” where the primary focus was development of an internal toolkit for handling REST Api calls; although, we also took over bugs and feature requests from other teams.</p>
                <p>During my time there I worked on several different aspects of the codebase. The primary focus was backend Java code but I also had the chance to do some front end work involving React to access and display data on the UI for an online teller page.</p>
                <p>Many of the skills required were learned on the job. There was an extensive onboarding process in which I was brought up to speed on a lot of the company specific workflow. The main thing I learned from class which helped though was how to work in an Agile team as it prepared me for working within and budgeting time in sprints.</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>Overall it was a very positive work experience. I learned a lot about working on APIs, backend development, collaborating in an Agile workflow, and contributing to enterprise software. I gained a lot of experience with Java, Yaml, React, Docker, Postman, and Jira. I am certain that I’m a better developer than I was when I started this work term and am confident that I will perform better in future job placements because of the experience I gained at NCR.</p>
