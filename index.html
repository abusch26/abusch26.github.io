            <h3>Abstract</h2>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>The purpose of this website is to inform the reader about my co-op work term(s), specifically the details of the work, what I learned, and how I’ve improved as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Info</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>My Fall 2023 work term was in Waterloo, Ontario at NCR, a banking software and teller hardware company. If you shop at Metro you’ve probably seen NCR branded self checkout machines but that’s the only example I’ve personally seen. About halfway through the term the company split into NCR Atleos and NCR Voyix to differentiate the hardware and software sides of the company respectively.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>As part of the University of Guelph co-op program I was required to create some goals at the start of the work term I’d hope to achieve by the end. Here’s what they were and how this work term helped me with them:</p>
                <ol>
                    <h4><li>Gain a better understanding of object oriented programming</li></h4>
                    <p>I set this as one of my goals as a good portion of the work was in Java and in class it wasn’t covered in depth. In the past I’d done plenty of Java work on personal projects but working in an existing codebase gave me a far better understanding of object oriented principles and how different aspects of the code should interact with each other. I’m especially glad that I was able to work on the full-stack team as it allowed me to piece together on my own how certain practices in the backend benefitted the front end. Being exposed to this gave me a much better understanding of why certain practices exist far more than I would have just studying them. Going forward I have a much better understanding of Java and the benefit of object oriented programming and I will definitely be able to write object oriented code better and far easier in my future work terms.</p>
                    
                    <h4><li>Learn Agile workflow concepts and work effectively within the SCRUM model</li></h4>
                    <p>Before this work term I’d never been in a real Agile team before; in class we had done group work where we tried to replicate the workflow but there were no daily stand-up or sprint/PI planning meetings, no SCRUM master, and no ticketing system. There was a lot that was only really mentioned or talked about in class which wouldn’t have made a whole lot of sense to do in the context of the group work so it was definitely a great learning experience to actually work within a real SCRUM environment. I was able to contribute in daily stand-ups, design meetings, and sprint planning and was exposed to pretty much every part of the agile workflow process not included in my past classes. At the start of the work term it seemed like a lot but now that I’ve had the experience of working in a proper Agile team I am confident in my abilities to work and collaborate with others far better in future job placements.</p>
                
                    <h4><li>Learn how to collaborate on enterprise software</li></h4>
                    <p>This was an important goal for me as I hadn’t worked on enterprise software before and was nervous about working on large repositories of code that I was unfamiliar with. I wanted to come out of this co-op term feeling confident in my abilities to understand and work with a team on a large codebase without breaking anything. After this term though I am confident in my ability to break down and understand large code bases and how various services interact with each other. While NCR’s codebase was daunting at first I’m certain that going forward I will have a much easier time effectively contributing to large scale software.</p>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>I was looking to get some experience with Docker as I hadn’t needed to learn it for school or personal projects before but had always heard it was extensively used. During this work term I was well exposed to working with Docker as well as a variety of other tools. Although I had used it before, I gained a lot of experience with postman this term as it was used to test API endpoints. Yaml was something I had only briefly touched in the past but it was used for all of the config files for the API I worked on so I got a lot of experience with properly setting up and using Swagger/List files. I also learned how to work with tickets in Jira which I hadn’t done before.Overall I think I completed each of the goals I set for myself and learned a good deal of new things I hadn’t initially planned/expected to.</p>

            <h3>Job Description</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>I was a part of one of the company’s Agile development teams, specifically the full-stack team “Draft” where the primary focus was development of an internal toolkit for handling REST Api calls; although, we also took over bugs and feature requests from other teams.</p>
                <p>During my time there I worked on several different aspects of the codebase. The primary focus was backend Java code but I also had the chance to do some front end work involving React to access and display data on the UI for an online teller page.</p>
                <p>Many of the skills required were learned on the job. There was an extensive onboarding process in which I was brought up to speed on a lot of the company specific workflow. The main thing I learned from class which helped though was how to work in an Agile team as it prepared me for working within and budgeting time in sprints.</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <div class="sub-center">
                <p>Overall it was a very positive work experience. I learned a lot about working on APIs, backend development, collaborating in an Agile workflow, and contributing to enterprise software. I gained a lot of experience with Java, Yaml, React, Docker, Postman, and Jira. I am certain that I’m a better developer than I was when I started this work term and am confident that I will perform better in future job placements because of the experience I gained at NCR.</p>
